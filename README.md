# üß™ Welcome to the Metabioinfomics GitHub Organization!

We are a research group based at the University of Padova, specialized in metagenomics applied to environmental sciences.


## üî¨ Reasearch

Our lab focuses on interdisciplinary research at the intersection of microbiology, bioinformatics, and environmental sustainability.:

* Microbial Ecology of Anaerobic Digestion
* Metagenomics and Metabolic Modeling
* Industrial Biotechnology and Food Systems
* Circular Economy and Bioprocess Engineering (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage)

For more information about our research activities, see the list of [projects](https://metabioinfomicslab.it/2023/12/22/projects/) and [publications](https://metabioinfomicslab.it/manuscripts-selection/)) on our lab website.

Our team collaborates across disciplines to publish open-source software and datasets that support reproducible science ‚Äî to learn more, check out our [tools](https://metabioinfomicslab.it/our-tools/) and browse our [repositories](https://github.com/example-lab).
